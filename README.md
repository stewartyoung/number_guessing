# THE QUESTION:
_The guess-a-number game starts with one player (the chooser) picking a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and secretly writing it down. The other player
(the guesser) attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the chooser responds with “correct” (the guesser guessed the number and the game is over),
“higher” (the actual number is higher than the guess), or “lower” (the actual
number is lower than the guess)._  
_What is the average number of guesses needed (assuming the chooser picks
the number randomly as before)?
_
